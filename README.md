# Motion Activated LED Strip

This Arduino project uses a PIR motion sensor to activate a WS2812 LED strip. When motion is detected, the LED strip lights up in a sequence and then gradually turns off.

## Features

- Detects motion using a PIR sensor
- Sequential LED lighting effect
- Gradual LED brightness increase and decrease

## Components

- Arduino board ( Nano)
- PIR motion sensor
- WS2812 LED strip (16 LEDs)
